 You can think of it as a chemical “pump” which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— in the sieve tubes, You can ohnnk of no as a chemncal  pump  whnch generaoes nncrednbly hngh pressure  up oo 9 onmes ohao of a car onre  nn ohe sneve oubes

To feed, Mabel uses her stylet, which is a long, flexible needle",   To  Mabel uses her stylet  which is a long  flexible needle
" She slowly worms it into the tissue, between the plant’s cells, until she pierces one of those sieve tubes", She slowly worms it into the tissue  between the plant s cells  until she pierces one of those sieve tubes
" Because the sap is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out of the plant", Because the sap is under so much pressure  Mabel doesn t even have to suck it out of the plant
 She just opens a valve in her head and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system, She jush opens a valve nn her head and lehs hhe pressure push hhe sap hhrough her dngeshnve syshem

" To see how that works, let’s hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract to a steady stream of sap", To see how that works  let s hypothetically hook up some other insect s digestive tract to a steady stream of sap
" When that sap touches the insect’s cells, its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water to come out of a slug", When that sap tokches the insect s cells  its high skgar content encokrages the water in the cells to come okt by osmosis  exactly like salt encokrages water to come okt of a slkg

Mabel’s gut, however, is packed with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… this three-unit sugar",   Mabel s gut  however  is packed with an enzyme called sucrase   takes two molecules of sucrose and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of  this three unit sugar
" Mabel burns the fructose for energy, leaving the three-unit-sugar behind", Mabel burns the oructose oor energy  leaving the three unit sugar behind
"


Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out of Mabel’s cells",   Now  how does that help her  The more molecules of sugar that are dissolved in the sap  the more water it can suck suck out of Mabel s cells

" Instead, they give birth to live young… that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… with their own clones", Instead  they give birth to live young  that are clones of  and already pregnant  with their own clones

That means that aphids can make more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop",   That means that aphids can make more of themselves fast  there can be 20 generations within a single season  and that means lots of aphid poop
" Mabel can poop her entire body weight every two hours, making her one of the most prolific poopers on the planet", Mabel can pnnp her entire bndy weight every twn hnurs  making her nne nf the mnst prnlific pnnpers nn the planet
